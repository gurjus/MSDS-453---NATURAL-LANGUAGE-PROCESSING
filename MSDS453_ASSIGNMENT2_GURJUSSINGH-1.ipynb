            "It also feels, at the same time, that Kosinski is a little impatient with some of the trappings he’s inherited – the disc battles and Light Cycle duels are dispensed with early on and never revisited, which is a pity because, as muddled and synapse-frying as these sequences are, they’re never topped elsewhere.\r\n",

For me, one such film is Tron: Legacy, it is the hill I am ready to die on and I love it with all my heart. \r\n",
            "The first area that the film excels in is the music and when you have Daft Punk working on your musical score then you know something special is about to happen. There is the electronic pulsing of The Game Has Changed, the lively strings of Outlands, and the warmth of the Finale. Where we really see this glory come to the foreground is towards the end of the second act when Sam makes his way through the city to the End of Line club where we get the apt title End of Line and also a cameo for the music makers themselves. To begin with we have a relatively mellow club track with a pulsating rhythm and drums underneath as Sam has entered a place of safety. Fun fact that there are a lot of samples of old video games including Commander Keen dropped throughout the song. Of course, no good deed goes unpunished and Zuse (Michael Sheen) turns on Sam bringing the more up-tempo Derezzed into play. The electronics rise and fall in quick succession, the drums are louder, the perfect music for a kick-ass action sequence. Then the moment Flynn arrives, the mood changes again and Fall starts as Zuse states ‘the aura was palpable’ and he’s not wrong. It is an amazing couple of minutes of cinema.               \r\n",
            "While the music is a centrepiece of the film, another key factor is just how beautiful the visuals are. From a visual effects perspective, the film was revolutionary with its de-ageing technic to bring CLU (Jeff Bridges/John Reardon) to life. Yes, we have gotten much better at it over the last ten years, and yes it does not always work, they probably should not have shown his face in close up at the start of the film in the real world. But nevertheless, it is still a marvel of the time and you still get sucked in thanks to Bridges performance. As well as the de-aging, the film is filled with visual effects of such high quality that they still hold up today. The world of the Grid is filled with a blending of physical and digital sets that combine flawlessly to create a fantastic world. Where we see that come to fruition is in the games, first the disk wars and then the light cycle battle.\r\n",

However, I also accept that, while the story is interesting, it’s more the experience that the focus should be on. Garrett Hedlund and Jeff Bridge work well together and their father/son relationship is believable.

Vehicles from the source material have been given a modern makeover and, while they look a lot more updated and colourful, they’re still recognizable.

A soundtrack should either accompany the visuals or elevate it, and this soundtrack did both effortlessly.\r\n",

While the plot is something that’s been repeated countless times, it’s the visuals and the soundtrack that should be focused on here.\n",

This, simply put, is one badass movie and while it has it’s flaws they’re easily overlooked because it just looks so damn good and has action that your probably not going to see anywhere else. In short, it’s almost exactly like the original Tron, and I think that’s a great thing.\r\n",

Years after the original ended Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) has had a child and his technology company, Encom, is making millions and billions of dollars. Then he simply disappears. Jump forward even more years and his son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund), has rejected his responsibility to run his father’s company despite being the majority stockholder. Suddenly a page comes from his father and he discovers, after all these years, his father’s lab at Flynn’s Arcade. A few keystrokes later and Sam is sucked into the computer world of the original film where he finds his father in a battle with Clu (a digitally younger Jeff Bridges) for control over the mainframe.\r\n",

Once Sam enters the computer (in a Wizard of Oz-inspired twist the 3D for the film doesn’t kick in until then) there’s a solid 30-minute span crammed with disc battles, bike races, and fistfights that simply blow you away with both how good it looks and how well it’s put together. Even more impressive is the use of 3D, especially during the bike scene, which uses 3D to great effect because of a multi-leveled arena where the bikes are racing around above and below each other. \r\n",

It’s hard to imagine the move being anywhere near as good without the digital soundtrack that they’ve laid down, and it should be getting an Oscar nod if for no other reason than it is one of the most original scores of the year.\r\n",

It might have come as a surprise to some that Tron had much of a legacy; the film was overshadowed by Spielberg's ET in that year, and in the UK suffered the mortification of being upstaged by Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract. Yet a generation grew up prizing Tron for being audacious, ahead of its time, a futurist trailblazer about games culture and the digital world. Its most famous legatee is Christopher Nolan, creator of Inception, and maybe that's the movie that original Tron fans would still prefer to watch.\r\n",

At the height of his sensational celebrity, Flynn vanished, and now in 2010 his boy Sam (Garrett Hedlund) tumbles into the virtual domain that his dad created, and where he is now in exile: this hidden universe is dominated by an unimaginably colossal gaming arena and is ruled by Kevin's evil alter ego Clu, his own digitally created younger self from 1989. Where once Kevin had hoped to draw upon the positive energies of this secret world – creating \"bio-digital jazz\" – the sinister Clu wants only to rule over a digital police state and preside over the cruel neo-imperial spectacle of games.\r\n",

The digital technology used to create the \"young\" Jeff Bridges is weird and not in a good way: this waxy, unlined figure resembles one of the Westworld robots, but looks less real. In the original 1982 Tron, the superimposition of glowing real human faces on computer-graphic figures might have seemed odd, yet it now arguably looks interestingly Soviet-heroic, or like something by Fritz Lang.\r\n",

And yet the effect is strangely   retro – the black-and-chrome stylings look like something from the late 1970s or early 80s. Nightclubs of the era looked a lot like this. And the sudden appearance of vivid-white boudoir spaces is taken straight from 2001: very Sanderson, very Stanley Kubrick. Successful or not, Tron was pushing the envelope, trying for something new, Tron: Legacy is paralysed by its reverence for the old.\n",

On the one hand, this new outing wants to be dark, moody science fiction full of Big Ideas. But it's also ostensibly a kids' movie, by a kids' studio, so it's obligated to stage the races and battles that audience demands. The result is an experience akin to trying to meditate on a roller coaster -- which may explain why Flynn, while trapped inside, seems to have become a kind of digital surfer bodhisattva, appending the word \"man\" to his sentences and doling out Zen proclamations like, \"I'm gonna go knock on the sky and listen to the sound.\" (Even in Tronworld, it seems, the Dude abides.)\r\n",

Sam  is encouraged by Kevin’s old friend Alan (Bruce Boxleitner) to investigate the origin of a message emanating from the arcade where the two older men once worked. There, Sam is inexplicably transported into the virtual-reality world known as The Grid. Inside the Grid, the digital inhabitants quickly identify Sam as a human, and bring him to their leader, Clu, who looks exactly like Kevin did as a young man. Eventually, Sam learns that his actual father is also inside the Grid, hiding from its dangerous ruler.\r\n",

            "So much of the 2010 movie relies on believing that Sam and his father are facing off against a virtual-reality creation that looks like a young Jeff Bridges, which means that much of the film relies on that virtual Bridges looking real. A large amount of Tron: Legacy’s budget was dedicated to the crucial FX surrounding Clu. Clu feels less like an authentically young Jeff Bridges, and more like an offshoot of the motion-capture horror-show of films of the uncanny-valley effect.\r\n",

            "While the rest of Tron: Legacy’s visual palette and its pulsating Daft Punk soundtrack are striking, the story, characters, and dialogue fall flat. To see Jeff Bridges in Big Lebowski mode as the elder Flynn, no one can sell an unironic line of dialogue like “It’s biodigital jazz, man!” The film’s clunkiest line, meant to describe the technological power of the Grid, but representative of its largely uninspired screenplay. \r\n",

It boasts multi-dimensional, complex performances from its two above-the-line leads. The film’s biggest selling point is Roger Deakins’ jaw-dropping cinematography — audiences really need to see this on the biggest screen possible, if only for the imagery — but Ryan Gosling’s performance is among his very best. K is an internal, subtly emotional character with a full, satisfactory arc, and Gosling brings an appropriate, welcome sense of complexity to the role. The script is perhaps overly solemn, and leaves some plot strands untied, but 2049 still has a sense of completeness and intelligence that’s unfortunately absent from Legacy.\r\n",

For those old enough to remember the ’80s, it’s like going home for Christmas and discovering a box full of childhood toys in your parents’ attic. This is what it felt like to watch Richard Donner’s “Superman” for the first time, or to marvel at the strong female role models of such vintage TV shows as “Wonder Woman” and “The Bionic Woman.” Even if the ’80s seem as distant to you as the World War I setting of Patty Jenkins’ history-making “Wonder Woman” feature three years ago, the sequel offers an amusing tour through that tackiest of decades, when shoulder pads and permed hair were all the rage.\n",

This time, it’s Steve’s turn to feel out of sync with society, as Diana makes a wish that resurrects her lost love, bringing him back to the year the Apple Macintosh was unveiled. In between, Zack Snyder made a noisy, present-day “Justice League” movie (due for a director’s cut next year), but Jenkins has a much better handle on what audiences want from the divine Miss Diana, and “Wonder Woman 1984” delivers, for a time.\n",

That robbery results in the recovery of the Dreamstone, an ancient citrine artifact with magic powers. The gem can grant the wish of anyone who touches it.

One theory fixates on the possibility that “The Shining” was Kubrick’s way of confessing he faked the landing on the moon footage, and another obsesses over the details of the hedge maze.

Her eyes find an attraction just off the main pier, and she walks into what looks like an abandoned hall of mirrors, discovering something deeply terrifying—her doppelgänger. The movie shifts to the present day, with Janelle Monae on the radio as the Wilson family is heading towards their vacation home. The little girl has now grown up to be a woman, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), nervous about returning to that spot on the Santa Cruz beach. Her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), thinks her reaction is overblown, but he tries to make her feel at ease so they can take their kids Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) to the beach and meet up with old friends, the Tylers (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker) and their twin daughters. After one small scare and a few strange coincidences on the beach, the family returns home for a quiet night in, only to have their peace broken by a most unlikely set of trespassers lined up across their driveway: doppelgängers of their family.\n",

In the film, the Jeremiah 11:11 Bible verse appears twice before pivotal moments, and there are plenty of other Biblical references to dig into, including an analogy to heaven and hell. Perhaps Jason’s “Jaws” shirt is a reference to the rocket sweater the little boy wears in “The Shining” or it could be a warning about the film’s oceanside dangers. In the ‘80s scene, when young Adelaide walks into the mysterious attraction, the sign welcoming her is that of a Native American in a headdress above the name “Shaman Vision Quest.”\n",
            "That old-time American religion of vengeance runs like a river through “True Grit,” a comic-serious tale about some nasty, brutish times. Beautifully adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen from the parodic western novel by Charles Portis, it turns on a 14-year-old Arkansas girl who hires a “one-eyed fat man” to hunt down her father’s killer. First published in 1968, Mr. Portis’s tall tale was brought to the screen the next year custom-fitted for John Wayne, who rode the role of that fat man, Rooster Cogburn, straight to an Oscar.

The pale, ghostly light comes courtesy of the Coens’ frequent cinematographer, Roger Deakins, while many of the twisty, funny sentences have been plucked by the filmmakers right from the novel. A deputy United States marshal, Rooster has attracted the interest of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld, in a terrific film debut), a half-pint who, with her bloodlust and severely braided hair, is an authentic American Gothic. As she listens to Rooster recount his bloody deeds and high body count, her eyes shine with a true believer’s excitement.\n",

At times she brings to mind D. H. Lawrence’s famed formulation that “the essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.” At other times, as when she wears her dead father’s oversize coat and hat, she looks like a foolish child left to perilous play.\n",

They have been surprisingly faithful to the tone and idiomatic tang of Mr. Portis’s novel, perhaps because its worldview suits their ironic purposes. The whiskey-soaked Rooster still likes to “pull a cork,” as he does in the book, and the Coens and Mr. Bridges get into the boozy spirit of things with slurs and pratfalls.\n",

I’d heard a bit about the movie—it would have been difficult, as a working film reviewer to not have—but not orally, so I thought that the title was pronounced with a long “o” or even a sort of “u,” so it rhymed with “Luke,” or, more pertinently, an obscure Italian-American slang word that Robert De Niro uses in “Raging Bull,” that word being “mamaluke.” As in, “I look like a mamaluke.” “A WHAT?” “Like a mamaluke. Like the mamaluke of the year.” Under this misapprehension, I actually underestimated this horror movie, the debut feature written and directed by Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent.\n",

            "I was wrong. Both about the pronunciation of the title character—it’s a short double-“o,” as in “look” or “book”—and what it implied for the movie, which as it turned out, is, in my opinion, the finest and most genuinely provocative horror movie to emerge in this still very-new century. Both a relentless psychological thriller with heavy primal stuff on its mind and a full-throttle slam-bang scare-fest, it delivers raw sensation without insulting the intelligence the way the more sensationalist but also essentially trite pictures in the New Horror Paradigm along the lines of “Insidious” tend to do. This is strictly my opinion, I am quick to point out. So impressed was I by “The Babadook” that upon seeing it I tweeted that I thought it might be the first capital-G “Great” horror movie of the 21st Century and was almost immediately beset upon by a couple of guys who thought I was out of my mind. “The Babadook” was both a snoozefest and ridiculous, and superior films included “Sinister” and “The Conjuring.” Now I’m not sure that “ridiculous” is a word that ought to be applied to horror movies, especially if you’re implying by comparison that stuff like “Sinister” and “The Conjuring” is NOT ridiculous. It’s all ridiculous in a sense. What makes a difference is how purposeful the ridiculousness is made to seem.\n",

The urgency is over, the child she was being rushed to the hospital to deliver is now in early elementary school. And the father is dead, killed in an accident during that trip to the hospital. And the child, a little boy, is a pip. Samuel (the cherub-faced Noah Wiseman, giving one of the most amazing and intense child-actor performances I’ve ever seen) spends a lot of time playing games and concocting crude weapons with which to protect himself and his mum from imaginary enemies, and he’s at work on this project day and night, loudly. When his vigilance isn’t literally wreaking havoc on the small house within which he and Amelia live in near-isolation, Sam is a needy clinger who won’t let his mum sleep.\n",

When you first see that Perry White, Clark's boss at the Daily Planet newspaper, is played by the formidable Frank Langella, you might expect he'd give Spidey's J.

Well, perhaps not nefarious so much as ridiculous: Luthor's evil plot involves stealing a crystal from Superman's arctic Fortress of Solitude and dropping it in the ocean off the Eastern seaboard.

            "\"The Witch,\" a period drama/horror film by first-time writer/director Robert Eggers, tellingly advertises itself as \"a New England folktale\" instead of a fairy tale. Fairy tales are, at heart, parables that prescribe moral values. \"The Witch,\" a feminist narrative that focuses on an American colonial family as they undergo what seems to be an otherworldly curse, is more like a sermon. Sermons pose questions that use pointedly allegorical symbols to make us reconsider our lives, just as one character uses the Book of Job to understand her role in her family (more on Job shortly).

And it's definitely not Katherine's mischievous young twins Jonas and Mercy (Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger, respectively), though Mercy does often speak for her and her brother's inability to understand how the world works after their family is banished to a foreboding forest by a nearby colony. The film's main protagonist might be William (Ralph Ineson), Katherine's troubled husband. Or it could be her eldest son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), a young man desperate to defend his father from his mother's frustration. \n",

Thomasin undergoes puberty under the mistrustful eyes of her family, but realistically, they're not too concerned with her when crops are failing, money is scarce, and Samuel is missing. Still, Thomasin absorbs the brunt of her family's anxieties: her younger siblings look to her for comfort, but she balks at the added pressure, especially after her mother makes her do more chores than the rest of her family members. There are other subplots in \"The Witch,\" but all roads eventually lead to Thomasin. That's the dark beauty of Eggers's expansive story: it's not just about the marginalized presence of women in a male-dominated microcosm, but the harsh conditions that can, even under extremely isolated circumstances, lead women to resentment, and crippling self-doubt.\n",

            "\"The Witch\" is, in that sense, an anti-parable. Eggers eventually leads Thomasin out of the woods, but he takes his time in clearing her path. The result sometimes feels like an imaginary Harold Pinter-scripted version of \"The Crucible,\" since it follows desperate, lonely souls who do everything—set animal traps, milk goats, till the fields, do laundry—to avoid thinking about what's really troubling them.

Concealed by curtains, she somehow escapes, as Houdini always did, but one night, Alfred ties her knots too tightly, she cannot escape, and by the time a manager (Michael Caine) rushes onstage with an ax, it is too late to save her from drowning.\n",

            "This sets off a lifelong hatred between Robert and Alfred, during which the frigid and ominous Alfred rises to the top of the profession. The hapless Alfred (now in love with his new assistant Olivia, played by Scarlett Johansson) falls to the bottom, is reduced to performing in flea pits, and yet presents an illusion named the Transported Man in which he walks into a door on one side of the stage and instantly emerges from a door at the other. How is that physically possible? It's the sort of thing that made his fans claim Houdini was supernormal. Robert becomes obsessed with finding the secret of the trick.\n",

            "But magicians do not explain their illusions, not even to their peers, unless money changes hands (\"The trick is told when the trick is sold\"). The Transported Man begins, you will agree, with a terrific Pledge. Now how will Robert ever discover the secret of the Prestige? He treks into the snows of Colorado to visit the hidden laboratory of the (real-life) Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), who may have manufactured the trick for Alfred. Tesla, the discoverer/inventor of alternating current, was believed at the time to be capable of all manner of wonders with the genie of electricity, but how could AC, or even DC, explain the Transported Man?\n",

I'm no good at it, even though I bored my friends for years with cheesy illusions, and even today can make a dime disappear from your forehead. These days I am most impressed with the skills required for close-up magic. Teddy Nava, the son of writer-directors Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas, can make cards change while I am holding them in my hands. Now how does he do that? Not through divine intervention, I am fairly sure. But I was holding them!\n",
            "\"Insidious\" is an affectionate visit to the Haunted House Movie, a genre that seems classic in contrast to Queasy-Cam gorefests.

Its purpose, in short, is to go BOO!\n",

            "“Inception” is not necessarily the kind of experience you would take to your next shrink appointment. It is more like a diverting reverie than a primal nightmare, something to be mused over rather than analyzed, something you may forget as soon as it’s over. Which is to say that the time — nearly two and a half hours — passes quickly and for the most part pleasantly, and that you see some things that are amazing, and amazingly pretty: cities that fold in on themselves like pulsing, three-dimensional maps; chases and fights that defy the laws that usually govern space, time and motion; Marion Cotillard’s face.\n",

            "Better to explain what Cobb does for a living, since that exhaustive enumeration of the metaphysical rules of his profession occupies an awful lot of the dialogue in Mr. Nolan’s script. Using a combination of drugs, wires and other vaguely Matrix-y methods, Cobb and his co-workers penetrate the minds of their slumbering targets, usually for the purpose of extracting hidden information. But a wealthy client named Saito (Ken Watanabe) induces them to try the much more difficult trick known as inception, which involves planting an idea someone else’s mind that will bear fruit in the real world. “That’s impossible!” more than one person has occasion to exclaim.\n",
            "\n",
            "In any case, Cobb and his team are trying to induce a young man (Cillian Murphy), whose father (Pete Postlethwaite) is a business rival of Saito’s, to break up the company he is about to inherit. This bit of commercial intrigue provides the banal material foundation on which Mr. Nolan’s phantasmagorical world is built.\n",
            "\n",
            "And the content of those dreams, once Cobb and company have dropped into their mark’s sleeping mind, is often curiously pedestrian. Most of the time, one group of guys with guns chases another, in cars across the rain-soaked streets of Los Angeles, on foot through the corridors of a retro-elegant hotel, and on skis and snowmobiles through an icy Alpine landscape from which James Bond might recently have departed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cobb, whose life depends on suppressing emotions and memories that he cannot control, is thus a typical Christopher Nolan hero. His air of guilt and sorrow — the sense of unfinished psychic business pushing against his conscious intentions — marks his kinship with Christian Bale’s Batman\n",
            "\n",
            "The accomplishments of “Inception” are mainly technical, which is faint praise only if you insist on expecting something more from commercial entertainment. That audiences do — and should — expect more is partly, I suspect, what has inspired some of the feverish early notices hailing “Inception” as a masterpiece, just as the desire for a certifiably great superhero movie led to the wild overrating of “The Dark Knight.” In both cases Mr. Nolan’s virtuosity as a conjurer of brilliant scenes and stunning set pieces, along with his ability to invest grandeur and novelty into conventional themes, have fostered the illusion that he is visionary.\n",

MacKay plays a young British soldier, Schofield, who just happens to be nearby when one of his mates, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), accepts a dangerous assignment: The two must cross enemy lines to deliver a message to British troops on the other side by the next day’s dawn.

The Army needs her help again, although this time the work is decidedly more esoteric: Aliens have arrived on Earth in a dozen giant craft scattered across the globe, one of them in the wilds of Montana. Colonel Weber would like Louise to come with him, learn the aliens’ language, and ask them why they are here. On the flight into Big Sky Country, she is introduced to her partner in this endeavor, a genial physicist named Ian Donelly.\n",

            "\n",
            "Accompanied by soldiers and technicians, Louise and Ian enter the craft by means of a square shaft in its base. Once inside, however, gravity releases them and then shifts 90 degrees, such that the shaft is now a corridor and one of its walls the floor. As Ian responded to the sudden inversion with “holy fuck,” I was right there with him.\n",

            "At the end of the corridor they meet their hosts, two giant, squid-like beings that float on the other side of a transparent barrier. Louise and Ian call them “heptapods” owing to their seven symmetrical tentacles, and name the two “Abbott” and “Costello,” because, well, why not? Efforts at verbal communication are unsuccessful, but written language proves more promising. From their starfish-like hands, the heptapods can emit swirling circles of inky gas, each one of them—as Louise concludes—a fully formed sentence with neither beginning nor end. Communication with the creatures moves slowly, but it at least begins to move.\n",
            "\n",
            ".As events unspool, we can sense that—like Louise with the heptapods—we do not entirely comprehend them. (We are correct in this.) As she and Ian try to decode the creatures’ language, they are constrained in their efforts by Colonel Weber and, especially, a CIA agent named Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg). Until we know more of the aliens’ intentions—conquest? tourism? cup of sugar?—Weber and Halpern are greatly concerned that we do not accidentally teach them more about ourselves than we learn about them.\n",

No prizes for predicting which team wins, or whether everything depends on a big final shot, or which coach makes a stirring speech about how it doesn't matter so much whether you win or lose - it's how you play the game. It must be said that this movie is sweet and innocent, and that at a certain level it might appeal to younger kids. I doubt if its ambitions reach much beyond that.\n",

The characters have the same names as the actors. All of the footage in the film was shot by two cameras--a color video camcorder operated by the director, Heather (Heather Donahue), and a 16-mm. black and white camera, operated by the cameraman, Josh (Joshua Leonard). Mike (Michael Williams) does the sound. All three carry backpacks, and are prepared for two or three nights of sleeping in tents in the woods. It doesn't work out that way.\n",

But the movie wisely doesn't present this information as if it can be trusted; it's gossip, legend and lore, passed along half-jokingly by local people, and Heather, Josh and Mike view it as good footage, not a warning.\n",

            "The latest by Canadian director Michael Dowse (Fubar, It’s All Gone Pete Tong), Goon may seem patterned off Rudy or Rocky in the way it follows Seann William Scott’s unlikely rise from the junior leagues to a farm team for an unlicensed National Hockey League stand-in. It was inspired by the true story of hockey pro Doug Smith, though, as reported in a biography adapted to the screen by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg. That aside, the film’s giddy violence and scatological humor share more in common with bygone hybrid sports-comedies like The Longest Yard, Major League, and, Necessary Roughness. Goon opens in a tiny Massachusetts town where Scott works as a barroom bouncer so big-hearted, he apologizes to patrons before knocking them out in the back alley. After defending his big-mouthed best friend (Baruchel) at a local hockey game, Scott gets called up to try out for the hometown team, where he’s re-christened “Doug The Thug.” His inability to skate is offset by his talent for taking down his opponents with a swift sock to the jaw, a gift that eventually gets him transferred to a Halifax farm team to protect a self-destructive star player (Marc-André Grondin) while preparing for a toe-to-toe with Liev Schreiber’s graying league-enforcer legend.\n",

But the movie’s real secret weapon is Scott. As in David Wain’s excellent Role Models (or the less excellent Southland Tales), Scott moves away from the smug-douche mugging of the American Pie films. He plays his thug as a gentle giant and a lovable oaf.\n",

It’s the rare hockey movie to approach violence head-on, without hectoring or hand-wringing, as an essential element of the sport, not some inhumane sideshow. Where George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot, the former reigning champ of the narrow hockey-film canon, descends into anticlimactic late-game zaniness, Goon fully commits to its theme of violence for violence’s sake.

            "Many movies like to toy with timelines, stirring up chronology or switching the order of events. Like few films before it, however, “Memento” truly turns the narrative editing into a specifically artistic endeavor, beginning not just at the end, but also playing out, scene by scene, in reverse. To complicate matters further, two storylines exist: the first is in color, moving backwards by scene (initially completely in reverse to show the only disconnected final shot); the second is in black-and-white and unfolds in order. By the conclusion, the two stories will meet, with the black-and-white turning to color. These baffling interchanges are also marked by a few key flashbacks and visions. As director Christopher Nolan’s second feature, “Memento” garnered Academy Award nominations for Editing and Screenplay, though it was relatively obscure upon its original release.

The good news is that it never gets boring, it’s well paced, and enthralling little details are discovered every time.

Similar to “Inception,” which created an entire dream-world mythology only to have its revolving-hallway tussle become its most iconic sequence, in “Tenet,” time inversion poses a civilization-annihilating threat, but the killer scene is, again, a corridor fight.

Leigh Anne and Sean first spot Michael in the school gym after one of Collins’s volleyball games, and on the drive home figure out that, even though he attends this private Christian academy on scholarship, he has no place to sleep.

            "Despite the serious, potentially stodgy subject matter — this is a movie that deals with both prejudice and Cartesian coordinates — the material is handled with a light touch. The lead trio are introduced at the side of a road: their ride, a sky-blue Chrysler, has broken down and a police officer is nosing about, suspicious. These two obstacles are deftly overcome, revealing the traits of each of the heroines and establishing their tight bond. Mary (Janelle Monáe) is a quick-witted thrillseeker; Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) is practical and unflappable; Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) is quiet but needle-sharp. As they are drafted into NASA, in demand for their smarts as the agency races to beat Russia to the moon, they are split up and have fewer scenes together. But each of them brings a different kind of strength to the screen. Henson gets the A-plot, pulled out of an all-women pool of computors and dropped into the main event, the previously male-only, Caucasian flight research team. Despite her promotion, rhere she is still subject to all manner of demeaning rules: she cannot pour herself a drink from the communal coffee pot, she is not allowed to attend briefing meetings, and when she needs the toilet she has to jog for 20 minutes to a distant restroom.

            "When Traveling Through Time, Pack a Change of Identities Jumping across time and space is tough, thankless business in “Predestination,” a slab of science-fiction speculation draped in old-fashioned detective story crepe. The story centers on a temporal agent, a futuristic enforcer (he tries to right wrongs before they happen) nicely played by Ethan Hawke with a hungry, hangdog look that suggests that his character has spent long nights howling in the wasteland, often without either a scrap or a prayer. Whether slinking through 1985 or another vintage year (usually while chasing down a bomber), the temporal agent looks like a classic lone wolf.He is and isn’t, as the story’s multiple twists gradually, if not altogether too clearly, reveal. The movie opens with a misterioso figure whose face is obscured by a fedora and some clever camera angles and editing. The noir atmospherics seem to have been included largely because the story jumps in and out of 1945, or perhaps because the writer-director brothers Peter and Michael Spierig like tipping their fedoras to film history. Whatever the case, after the bandages come off in one decade, the newly mustachioed temporal agent turns up tending bar in another, pouring shots for a man curiously known only as the Unmarried Mother (Sarah Snook, wearing a sneer and a sack suit). The Unmarried Mother writes confession stories from the women’s angle, one he knows intimately. He has a story to tell, which begins with “When I was a little girl” and leaps across the years and yawning gaps in logic.The source for all this jumpy action is Robert A. Heinlein’s “All You Zombies,” a mind-and-body-bending short-story classic that he wrote in 1958. From its many temporal and sexual kinks, the story suggests that Mr. Heinlein was looking to dust off H. G. Wells’s time-travel machinations with some 1950s-style transgender sizzle borrowed from one of the tale’s touchstones, Christine Jorgensen. Ms. Snook looks remarkably like a Leonardo DiCaprio cousin when duded up, but is more persuasive when dolled up in period dresses with a slash of red lipstick. She smoothly maneuvers through the labyrinthine plot and in and out of his-and-her threads, but the character might have worked better, particularly for the would-be shocker ending, with someone with less natural va-va-voom appeal.Although he disappears for large stretches, Mr. Hawke serves as both the narrator and the story’s ballast amid all the woo-woo interludes and disruptions, the puzzle piece you hold and worry about even as the scenery changes and identities shift. His temporal agent contains sly multitudes and could easily have become a gimmick, but Mr. Hawke brings enough pathos and soul to his performance that the conceit soon becomes a man — well, for starters.\n",

In a nutshell, Mr. James looked at baseball statistics in a different light, less by breaking the numbers down in another way but by seeing that what appeared to be objective facts, like fielding statistics, were, as he wrote, “a record of opinions.” And these numbers didn’t just describe baseball; they gave the game its language, its “fiction and drama and poetry.”\n",

            "After all that, it probably doesn't sound like there's anything worthwhile in Lynch's film. That's far from the truth. It’s certainly a different kind of sci fi than Star Wars, which was created to comfort and entertain. Dune wanted to challenge, and though its stumbling attempts to pontificate on religion and ecology may have been its downfall, those attempts also produced some of the film's most resonant moments.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the movie's goal was to create, like the book, a world that felt utterly alien, then Lynch and his surreal style were the right choice. With its bizarre dream sequences, rife with images of unborn fetuses and shimmering energies, and unsettling scenery like the industrial hell of the Harkonnen homeworld, the film’s actually closer to Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey) than Lucas. It seeks to put the viewer somewhere unfamiliar while hinting at a greater, hidden story.\n",
            "\n",
            "The special effects were not particularly impressive from a technical standpoint, something critics eagerly pointed out. But the miniature sets, created mostly by Emilio Ruiz del Río, achieve a staggering sense of scale. Watch the scene where the Atreides fleet departs for Arrakis. Dozens of already massive ships file into what looks like an ornate keyhole, instantly dwarfing them in the viewer’s eye and creating a sense of ponderous motion fit for a massive interstellar space craft. The novel’s iconic sandworms feel similarly gargantuan onscreen as they rumble out of the barren desert.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before his death in 1986, Herbert said that he was largely pleased with Lynch’s film's representation of his universe. You can understand why. While it's hardly a cohesive experience, individual scenes are brought to life with striking power. Watching Dune today holds the same joy as flipping through an illustrated version of the novel. Considering the density and imagination of Herbert's world, that should count as something of an achievement.\n",
            "Dunkirk is an impressionist masterpiece. Somber, grim and as resolute in its creative confidence as the British are in this ultimate historical narrative of having one's back to the wall, this is the film that Christopher Nolan earned the right to make thanks to his abundant contributions to Warner Bros. with his Dark Knight trilogy.\n",

            "The third major narrative thread involves the brave effort of a middle-aged civilian sailor, Dawson (Mark Rylance), and his teenaged-son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) to sail their small private yacht across the Channel to bring home whomever they can. \n",

            "\n",
            "Dunkirk also vividly contrasts the hugely different ways in which the soldiers experienced the same event. The hundreds of thousands of soldiers are at once all in this vast struggle together and quite on their own to respond as each moment demands.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of Nolan's films are intensely visual, but it's fair to say that Dunkirk is especially so, given the sparseness, and strict functionality, of the dialogue. Hardy probably has a half-dozen lines in the whole picture and, given his mask, does most of his acting with his eyes, something at which he's become very good indeed. \n",
            "\n",
            "There's never a sense of Nolan — unlike, say Spielberg — manipulating the drama in order to play the viewer's heartstrings. Nor is there anything resembling a John Williams score to stir the emotional pot.\n",

            "In what has to be one of the most adventurous of his countless soundtracks, Hans Zimmer enormously strengthens the film with a work that equally incorporates both sound and music to extraordinary effect. \n",

            "So the climax of the film, as beautiful as it is thanks to the visually stunning presentation of Hardy's character's fate, is more like the beginning of the real war.\n",

            "In Dunkirk, Nolan has gotten everything just right.\n",

            "1. When it was first announced that gifted young actor Miles Teller would be playing Reed Richards (a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic), I assumed he’d be “aging up” for the role. After all, since the launch of Marvel’s “first family” in 1961, Richards—whose primary physical signifiers included gray temples and pipe-smoking—had been among the most prominent patres familias in comic-dom. But in fact the reverse is the case. Teller, 28, plays Richards as an 18-year-old: a self-taught, world-class genius who cracks the secret of inter-dimensional travel for his high-school science fair. If this sounds like a peculiar knockoff of the 2007 animated comedy Meet the Robinsons, well, that’s exactly how it plays—though with considerably less charm.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. I should note here that we in fact first meet Reed and his friend Ben Grimm (a.k.a. the Thing) as fifth-graders, growing up in working-class Oyster Bay on Long Island. Reed has already created a working prototype of an inter-dimensional teleporter from spare parts in his garage. Ben, meanwhile, is being bullied by a thuggish older brother who shouts, “it’s clobberin’ time” while beating him up. The addition of this sad backstory to the Thing’s trademark catchphrase (which, yes, we’ll hear at the end of the movie) is not an improvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. But back to the science fair. Reed and Ben (Jamie Bell) show off their teleporter by sending a toy airplane into the beyond and back, but they are disqualified when their experiment also sends out an energy pulse that shatters the backboard of the school gymnasium. Luckily, who should show up at the fair but an avuncular scientist, Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter, Sue (Kate Mara). They, too, have been experimenting with inter-dimensional travel, but they have never been able to bring back the objects they have sent out. (Why they are trolling high-school science fairs in search of talent to help them achieve this breakthrough is a question better left unasked.) Dr. Storm immediately offers Reed a full scholarship to the “Baxter Foundation” in Manhattan, which the latter gleefully accepts.

            "Having become the first woman to win the Oscar for best director with The Hurt Locker in 2010, Kathryn Bigelow became the focus of controversy when 2012’s Zero Dark Thirty was accused of somehow endorsing the use of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden (Naomi Wolf ludicrously compared Bigelow to Leni Riefenstahl). Torture rears its ugly head again in Detroit, but this time in a context that leaves no room for misinterpretation. Revisiting a shocking “incident” that took place amid five days of rioting in the summer of 1967, Detroit is a provocative period piece made all the more alarming by its stark contemporary relevance. More than 40 people died during the so-called “Detroit rebellion”, most of them African Americans, many shot by the police or national guardsmen. In attempting to unpack “the anatomy of an uprising”, Bigelow focuses in on a harrowing tragedy that has become emblematic of the racial tensions still haunting the US.\n",

            "Detroit opens with a contextualising history lesson, animating Jacob Lawrence’s vivid paintings of the “great migration” to recount the movement of African Americans from the rural south toward the industrialised north and midwest.

But it’s when Krauss and his uniformed henchmen descend upon an annex of the Algiers motel, where Reed and Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) have sought safe haven, that Detroit shifts into something resembling a horror movie – a genre last explored by Bigelow in her vampire-western Near Dark. \n",
            "\n",
            "Paul Greengrass’s regular cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, who brought such urgent verisimilitude to Bigelow and Boal’s The Hurt Locker, once again lends a documentarian’s eye to the drama, using vintage lenses to capture multi-angle digital footage (largely shot around Boston), which interweaves seamlessly with archive material. Just as Point Break plunged its audience into breakneck chases and Strange Days toyed with virtual reality (a medium recently explored by Bigelow in the ivory-poachers documentary short The Protectors), so Detroit is an immersive experience which places the viewer at the heart of this unfolding chaos. It’s a sprawling, volatile melee of a movie, excellently edited by William Goldenberg and Harry Yoon, who jostle their way through a crowd of stories to focus in on one claustrophobic flashpoint.\n",
            "\n",
            "Crucially, despite the efficiently evoked period setting (plaudits to production designer Jeremy Hindle) there’s nothing distant about Detroit. As a broad-canvas work that shifts from social realism to courtroom drama via crime thriller, musical fantasy and social chiller, it confirms Bigelow as a dextrous master of her craft. As a wake-up call to a nation, it is tense, tough and terrifyingly timely.\n",

            "In the mood for allegory? Have a look at Bong Joon-ho’s “Snowpiercer,” which proceeds from a fantastical premise rich with real-world relevance. After a human-engineered planetary catastrophe (trying to arrest the planet’s warming, we accidentally froze it solid), the remaining people are stuck on a train that never stops moving. A few thousand survivors live in railway cars, sorted into a rigid and ruthlessly enforced social order. In the back are huddled masses fed on gelatinous, insect-based black protein bars and kept in line by a combination of propaganda and brute force. Toward the front, the more fortunate enjoy access to schools, nightclubs, fresh food and the reassurance that they deserve everything they have. An unseen, quasi-mythical entrepreneur is in charge, and a group of rebels have decided to challenge his power and the extreme inequality he represents.\n",

            "There are soldiers in riot gear, armed with clubs and guns, but for Mr. Bong evil is never anonymous. He gives it a grotesque, human face — or rather a series of faces, most memorably Tilda Swinton’s, almost unrecognizable in prosthetic teeth and oversize glasses. She serves as a kind of spokeswoman for Mr. Wilford (Ed Harris), the enigmatic engineer who is both dictator and deity in this postapocalyptic world. As the train moves in its long, winding route around the globe, teetering on the edge of both sustainability and plausibility, Curtis and his comrades undertake a long march toward the engine. They are joined by Minsu (the great shape-shifting South Korean actor Song Kang-ho), a security specialist, and his daughter, Yona (Ko Ah-sung), both addicted to an inhalant called Kronole.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like most dystopian science fiction, “Snowpiercer” has a lot of explaining to do. The idea of a high-speed train chugging through glaciers has a children’s-book charm, and the original graphic novel has some stylistic kinship with Chris Van Allsburg’s “The Polar Express.” But Mr. Bong is interested above all in imagining how the whole thing might work, as a matter of technology and social organization. And so every episode of fighting or conspiring is accompanied by a dollop of exposition, some of it recalling the start of the journey (18 years before the action takes place), some surveying its present condition and some looking around for clues about whether or how it might end.\n",
            "\n",
            "And though the movie is playfully postmodern in its pastiche of styles and its mingling of sincerity and self-consciousness, there is also something solidly old-fashioned about the way it tells its story. Long, crowded and ambitious almost to the point of hubris, it reminded me a little of “The Poseidon Adventure” and other 1970s-vintage action allegories full of great actors struggling to survive. That’s a compliment, by the way. Disaster has become a matter of routine at the movies (in more ways than one). Planetary destruction and human extinction happen a half-dozen times every summer. It’s rarely this refreshing, though.\n",

You can feel Coogler’s affection for the material in every frame. Hell, the story Coogler cooked up with co-writer Aaron Covington is a virtual template of the first film.

            "Brief Summary: James Cameron's \"Titanic\" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the \"ship of dreams\" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912. \n",

Think back also, exactly 58 years ago today, to the Dec. 19 New York premiere of another grand, transporting love story set against a backdrop of prideful excess, cataclysmic upheaval and character-defining trial by fire.\n",

Just as David O. Selznick had Atlanta to burn, now James Cameron has a ship to sink, but he also has much more than calamity to explore in this gloriously retrograde new epic. Mr. Cameron's magnificent ''Titanic'' is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to ''Gone With the Wind.''\n",
            "\n",
            "What a rarity that makes it in today's world of meaningless gimmicks and short attention spans: a huge, thrilling three-and-a-quarter-hour experience that unerringly lures viewers into the beauty and heartbreak of its lost world. Astonishing technological advances are at work here, but only in the service of one spectacular illusion: that the ship is afloat again, and that the audience is intimately involved in its voyage.\n",

            "Though the tender moments in Mr. Cameron's earlier films have mostly involved Arnold Schwarzenegger, graceful storytelling from this one-man army of a filmmaker (a director, a producer, a writer and an editor) is the biggest of many surprises here. Swept away by the romance of his subject matter, Mr. Cameron rises to the occasion with a simple, captivating narrative style, one that cares little for subtlety but overflows with wonderful, well-chosen Hollywood hokum. In its own sobering way, the film is forward-looking, too, as its early brashness gives way to near-religious humility when the moments of reckoning arrive.\n",
            "Kal Ho Naa Ho is the pinnacle of what I call the Shah Rukh Khan charm offensive. Here he plays Aman, a terminally ill man, who is so noble and large-hearted, that he engineers that the woman he loves – Naina – marries her best friend – Rohit – instead of Aman himself because he’s not going to be around too long. Kal Ho Naa Ho is basically a mash-up of two Hrishikesh Mukherjee films – Bawarchi and Anand – and Shah Rukh becomes the modern day avatar of Rajesh Khanna – exemplifying the line, “Zindagi badi honi chahiye, lambi nahin.” So Aman is also the farishta or angel who brings love and laughter into Naina’s tragic life. Early in the film, Naina, her mother and her younger siblings are praying. Naina says: “Dear god, if you’re listening, in andheron mein thodi si roshni le aao, thodi si roshni.”And on cue, the light goes on in the neighboring house and Aman walks into the balcony, wearing only a shirt in the snow. The next day, it’s summer.\n",

            "Kal Ho Naa Ho is filled with these ridiculously convenient plots twists, obviously manipulative emotional moments and problematic gender politics- at one point, Aman concocts a romantic scheme which he describes as ‘chhe din ladki in‘. But the one thing that helps you overlook all of this is Shah Rukh in all his glory – as both romantic hero and the ultimate family man. Of course there is no subtlety here – he’s animated, energetic and even when he’s dying, fabulously over the top.\n",

There is such a desperate longing in his eyes. Or in another scene, Rohit and Naina do the salsa together while he watches, god-like from a balcony above. The strains of the title song begin. Aman purses his lips, looks into the distance. Cut to him walking on Brooklyn Bridge. He spreads his arms and sings, har pal yahan jee bhar jiyo because of course, kal ho naa ho.

It is based on the life of former Test, ODI and T20I captain of the Indian national cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The film stars Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni, along with Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher. The film chronicles the life of Dhoni from a young age through a series of life events. \n",

            "You don’t have to understand cricket to enjoy a good cricket movie. “Lagaan” (2001), whose centerpiece was a rousing match of underdog (Indian) versus overdog (British colonials), got the heart pounding, even if you couldn’t follow all the ins and outs of the game. It was the rare Bollywood movie to reach across the aisle, as it were, attracting moviegoers beyond the faithful.\n",

            "To warm to the biopic “M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story,” you probably do have to be a cricket fan, and an indulgent one at that. Long (180 minutes) and languid, it takes you through the life of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the unflappable captain of the Indian cricket team that won the 2011 World Cup.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput), as presented here, is a natural athlete — cricket wasn’t even his sport of choice as a boy — a nice guy and, in the end, something like a national hero. He meets setbacks with a pause (a kind of timeout) and a hard-to-read smile. Then he goes on. What makes him tick? That remains the untold story.\n",

            "The movie, written and directed by Neeraj Pandey, is not hagiographic or overly obvious.

            "This isn’t Ridley Scott’s first trip to space but the director of “Alien” and “Prometheus” takes a different kind of journey in “The Martian.” Thrilling, funny and, above all, human, it’s a crowd-pleasing story about the power of the will to survive.\n",

A botanist by trade, to survive he knows he’ll have to “science the BLEEP out of this.” Rationing the food left behind and growing his own potatoes he’s able to feed himself, but the supplies won’t last forever.\n",

            "\n",
            "The trick to casting a movie like “The Martian” lies in finding an actor able to hold the screen for extended periods of time by himself while being likeable enough to have an audience care whether or not he makes it back to Earth in one piece. Since Tom Hanks has aged out of playing roles like this, Damon, recently named as Hollywood’s Most Bankable Actor by Forbes, is that guy. His mix of humour, smarts and all-American problem solving keep you invested in Watney during the long stretches he putters around finding ways beat the insurmountable odds.\n",
            "\n",
            "The rest of the film isn’t as engaging as Damon’s “Castaway” act. “The Martian” is composed of three components: Life on Mars, Ground Control and the Space Cowboys who hurtle through the universe to rescue their lost friend. Each are well cast—Jeff Daniels is perfect as the spearhead of the NASA rescue and Peña brings some wonky good humour—but the when the film leaves the Red Planet it leaves some of its heart behind. There is drama, conflict and even some humour in all segments, but the compelling stuff happens when the film is at its quietest, when Damon is alone MacGyvering his way out of a bad situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The Martian” is a fun film, a space Western about the strength of the human spirit and the indomitable will. “Interstellar” tread similar thematic ground last year but did so without the humour, the cheesy 70’s soundtrack or, most importantly, Matt Damon.\n",
            "In the middle of this epic film there is a quiet, small scene that helps explain why “Gandhi” is such a remarkable experience. Mahatma Gandhi, at the height of his power and his fame, stands by the side of a lake with his wife of many years. Together, for the benefit of a visitor from the West, they reenact their marriage vows. They do it with solemnity, quiet warmth, and perhaps just a touch of shyness; they are simultaneously demonstrating an aspect of Indian culture and touching on something very personal to them both. At the end of the ceremony, Gandhi says, \"We were thirteen at the time.\" He shrugs. The marriage had been arranged. Gandhi and his wife had not been in love, had not been old enough for love, and yet love had grown between them. But that is not really the point of the scene. The point, I think, comes in the quiet smile with which Gandhi says the words. At that moment we believe that he is fully and truly human, and at that moment, a turning point in the film, Gandhi declares that it is not only a historical record but a breathing, living document. \n",
            "\n",
            "This is the sort of rare epic film that spans the decades, that uses the proverbial cast of thousands, and yet follows a human thread from beginning to end: “Gandhi” is no more overwhelmed by the scope of its production than was Gandhi overwhelmed by all the glory of the British Empire. The movie earns comparison with two classic works by David Lean, “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Doctor Zhivago”, in its ability to paint a strong human story on a very large canvas. \n",
            "\n",
            "The movie is a labor of love by Sir Richard Attenborough, who struggled for years to get financing for his huge but \"non-commercial\" project. Various actors were considered over the years for the all-important title role, but the actor who was finally chosen, Ben Kingsley, makes the role so completely his own that there is a genuine feeling that the spirit of Gandhi is on the screen. Kingsley's performance is powerful without being loud or histrionic; he is almost always quiet, observant, and soft-spoken on the screen, and yet his performance comes across with such might that we realize, afterward, that the sheer moral force of Gandhi must have been behind the words. Apart from all its other qualities, what makes this movie special is that it was obviously made by people who believed in it. \n",
            "\n",
            "What is important about this film is not that it serves as a history lesson (although it does) but that, at a time when the threat of nuclear holocaust hangs ominously in the air, it reminds us that we are, after all, human, and thus capable of the most extraordinary and wonderful achievements, simply through the use of our imagination, our will, and our sense of right.\n",
            "A fundamental difference between “The Silence of the Lambs” and its sequel, “Hannibal,” is that the former is frightening, involving and disturbing, while the latter is merely disturbing. It is easy enough to construct a geek show if you start with a cannibal. The secret of “Silence” is that it doesn't start with the cannibal--it arrives at him, through the eyes and minds of a young woman. “Silence of the Lambs” is the story of Clarice Starling, the FBI trainee played by Jodie Foster, and the story follows her without substantial interruption. Dr. Hannibal Lecter lurks at the heart of the story, a malevolent but somehow likable presence--likable because he likes Clarice, and helps her. But Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins, is the sideshow, and Clarice is in the center ring.\n",
            "\n",
            "The popularity of Jonathan Demme's movie is likely to last as long as there is a market for being scared. Like “Nosferatu,” “Psycho” and “Halloween,” it illustrates that the best thrillers don't age. Fear is a universal emotion and a timeless one. But “Silence of the Lambs” is not merely a thrill show. It is also about two of the most memorable characters in movie history, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, and their strange, strained relationship (“people will say we're in love,” Lecter cackles).\n",
            "\n",
            "They share so much. Both are ostracized by the worlds they want to inhabit--Lecter, by the human race because he is a serial killer and a cannibal, and Clarice, by the law enforcement profession because she is a woman. Both feel powerless--Lecter because he is locked in a maximum security prison (and bound and gagged like King Kong when he is moved), and Clarice because she is surrounded by men who tower over her and fondle her with their eyes. Both use their powers of persuasion to escape from their traps--Lecter is able to rid himself of the pest in the next cell by talking him into choking on his own tongue, and Clarice is able to persuade Lecter to aid her in the search for the serial killer named Buffalo Bill. And both share similar childhood wounds. Lecter is touched when he learns that Clarice lost both her parents at an early age, was shipped off to relatives, was essentially an unloved orphan. And Lecter himself was a victim of child abuse (on the DVD commentary track, Demme says he regrets not underlining this more).\n",
            "\n",
            "These parallel themes are mirrored by patterns in the visual strategy. Note that both Lecter in his prison cell and Buffalo Bill in his basement are arrived at by Starling after descending several flights of stairs and passing through several doors; they live in underworlds. Note the way the movie always seems to be looking at Clarice: The point-of-view camera takes the place of the scrutinizing men in her life, and when she enters dangerous spaces, it is there waiting for her instead of following her in.\n",
            "For his part, the director, Ivan Reitman, does an efficient job disguising this marshmallowy melodrama of masculinity in crisis as a tough sports movie. “Draft Day,” with a ticking-clock plot and a testosterone-saturated setting, trots along briskly, even though most of the action consists of rushed cellphone negotiations. A sinuous split-screen technique cleverly adds momentum to a series of static conversations, though it is finally Mr. Costner’s charisma that weaves it all together.\n",

            "\n",
            "“Draft Day,” made with what appears to be the very enthusiastic — not to say domineering — cooperation of the N.F.L., is less a football movie than a promotional film. You will see sweeping aerial shots of skylines and stadiums in franchise cities. You will see the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, and a bunch of players and executives, past and present, gamely portraying themselves. You will not hear anything about concussions or sexual assault or the exploitation of college athletes, though you may notice that this is a story of (mostly) white men buying and selling the labor of (mostly) African-Americans. But the spectacle of guys in suits making deals is nonetheless pretty entertaining, and while this film doesn’t have the fussy authenticity of “Moneyball,” it does offer a reasonably clear and convincing glimpse of the business of big-time sports.\n",

The answer is telegraphed early, but the fun lies in watching Sonny hustle, bluster and beg his way toward a conclusion that is both predictable and exciting. In addition to rival general managers, he must contend with the Browns’ imperious owner (Frank Langella) and their pugnacious coach (Denis Leary).

He has a knack for making born winners look like underdogs, and for making you root for him at his most brazenly manipulative. I don’t really buy “Draft Day” — it’s a shallow and evasive movie, built more around corporate wish fulfillment than around reality — but I have to say that it sells itself beautifully.\n",

            "\n",
            "Long ago, in the ancient year of 1998, Disney tried something tricky: an animated princess musical that was also an action movie, with big fight scenes no doubt aimed at appealing to little boys who may have balked at another Beauty and the Beast or Little Mermaid. (For such balking was encouraged in boys more back then than it is now, though it is still plenty encouraged.) In making Mulan‚Äîbased on the Chinese legend of warrior woman Hua Mulan, who fights for the emperor‚Äôs army in her father‚Äôs stead, disguised as a man‚Äîalso continued a half-hearted project of diversity, adding more global shape to its princess canon. It was, at the time, a big deal.\n",
            "\n",
            "The film, directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, earned that bigness in enough places. There was the powerhouse ballad ‚ÄúReflection,‚Äù sung by Lea Salonga in the film but rerecorded by Christina Aguilera, the belter‚Äôs first single and still one of her most enduring songs. And there was an eye-popping mountain battle scene, aided by ever more confident computer animation, in which an invading horde of Huns is subsumed by an avalanche. It‚Äôs stunning stuff, still now, even though much of the rest of the hand-drawn animation looks so sadly quaint from the vantage point of the digital age.\n",
            "\n",
            "Without the songs and silliness of the 1998 original, 2020‚Äôs Mulan throws itself into comparison not with other children‚Äôs classics, but with hundreds of other sword-and-sandal films that have all pretty much done what Mulan does before. Caro, filming in New Zealand and China, finds some stunning backdrops. The costumes look great. The martial arts sequences nicely approximate the fluid, floating grace of wuxia films. But somehow Mulan‚Äôs assets don‚Äôt coalesce into a thrilling whole. It‚Äôs certainly significant that there is a big Disney film with a Chinese actor, Liu Yifei, as its star. But watching Mulan, one gets the sense that this triumph of representation was considered enough‚Äîlike the job was done once casting was finished, and everything else was just mechanical detail. Mulan deserves better, as does Liu, as do eager audiences.\n",
            "\n",
            "Would that some of that magic had been applied elsewhere. Mulan‚Äôs choppy script, from four credited writers, has no time for flights of fancy or emotional depth. Instead it hurries us through the basic beats of Mulan‚Äôs story, from humble village girl bound for arranged marriage to military hero of the empire, and, after some just-fine battle sequences, dumps us out at the end, gesturing heavily toward an impressiveness it never actually conjured. Though Liu holds her scenes well, we barely even know Mulan. She‚Äôs a mere cipher‚Äîan emblem with which a huge studio can pat itself on the back, proud to offer this lukewarm plate of inspirational content before moving on to the next whatever. Who is that girl I see, indeed.\n",

            "There‚Äôs always been a fairytale element to Kenneth Branagh‚Äôs directing career; the question of whether or not he‚Äôll go to the ball tends to hang over all his movies, right up until the clock strikes 12. One of Branagh‚Äôs finest fantasy flicks, Mary Shelley‚Äôs Frankenstein, was as cruelly treated as any of Charles Perrault‚Äôs fabled heroines, while the marvellously Ken Russell-esque The Magic Flute signally failed to be showered with riches or made the belle of any box-office ball. Meanwhile, the Hitchcock pastiche Dead Again went from being a copper-bottomed catastrophe to a Stateside hit after an 11th-hour sprinkling of fairy dust (in the form of reprocessed black-and-white flashbacks) turned it from pauper to princess. Most remarkably, Branagh took the straw of Marvel‚Äôs Thor comic strip and spun from it the gold of a surprisingly witty blockbuster (Transformers meets Xanadu), a remarkable feat of movie magic.\n",
            "\n",
            "And so to Cinderella, a live-action reboot of one of Disney‚Äôs most enduring animations (the credits cite their ‚ÄúCinderella properties‚Äù alongside Perrault), notable for its straight-faced sentimentality and unfashionable absence of post-Enchanted irony. While Maleficent and Into the Woods unpicked their fairytale roots, Chris Weitz‚Äôs screenplay is almost radically anti-revisionist in its refusal to rewrite familiar tropes. This is an unashamedly old-fashioned world of pumpkin coaches, glass slippers and chimes-at-midnight transformations. Why, Cinders even talks to the tiny mice who are the only friends in her coal-scuttle existence; I half expected her to burst into a chorus of A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes. Resisting modern urban updates, Branagh thus returns us to the strange netherworld of European folklore and Disney Americana upon which the House of Mouse was built. If that sounds fantastically unexciting, a $132m worldwide opening proves that Branagh‚Äôs ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù instincts were entirely on the money.\n",

Yet while this throwback Cinderella may not enjoy the questing action-adventure of the ass-kicking heroines of Brave or Frozen (the Frozen Fever short provides a crowd-pulling curtain-raiser), she is more independent-spirited than her critics have acknowledged. Living by her mother‚Äôs deathbed mantra ‚ÄúHave courage and be kind‚Äù, this lonely girl is unimpressed by wealth (she falls not for a prince but an ‚Äúapprentice‚Äù whom she meets on equal ground), unimpeded by fear (she outrides the royal hunt in defence of a befriended stag), and undaunted by the spectacular cruelty of her step-family. \n",

It‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast,‚Äù for goodness‚Äô sake: a tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme and all that.

Its classicism feels unforced and fresh. Its romance neither winks nor panders. It looks good, moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste.

Gaston is sweet on Belle, and his excitement at her unambiguous refusals makes him the film‚Äôs avatar of nastiness. No redemption here.

            "\n",
            "The key image in Walt Disney‚Äôs 1941 ‚ÄúDumbo‚Äù is something out of a fairy-tale daydream: Dumbo, the baby elephant with long-lashed goo-goo eyes, a cuddly grin, and ears as long and floppy as wings, flapping those ears to soar around a circus big top, flying over the crowds with a freedom as touching as it is inexplicable. It‚Äôs one of the purest images in movies. ‚ÄúDumbo‚Äù was Disney‚Äôs fourth animated feature (after ‚ÄúSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,‚Äù ‚ÄúPinocchio,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFantasia‚Äù), and like Dumbo himself it‚Äôs a beautiful oddball ‚Äî a solid-colored piece of stylized pop Americana, only 64 minutes long, at times almost a silent movie with sound effects. One of the more remarkable things about it is that Dumbo, after being cruelly separated from his mother (a primal twist that anticipates ‚ÄúBambi‚Äù), doesn‚Äôt discover his ability to fly until the last six minutes of the movie. When he does, he becomes a creature as enchanted in his yearning and escape as King Kong up on the Empire State Building or E.T. hoisting a bicycle into the sky. In ‚ÄúDumbo,‚Äù the magic of Dumbo‚Äôs ability to fly comes at the audience like a heavenly afterthought, one that tosses us into the sublime and leaves us there.\n",
            "The flying sequences in Tim Burton‚Äôs ‚ÄúDumbo,‚Äù a live-action reimagining of the Disney classic, have a touch of that same wonderstuck quality. Dumbo, now created with animatronic and digital effects, is still a cute, lonely pachyderm with impossibly large floppy ears who speaks to us with his soft pleading anthropomorphic Keane eyes (he has no dialogue.) When he‚Äôs slathered in clown make-up and forced to stand on top of a towering circus platform, his fear and humiliation are palpable. Then, after ingesting a feather into his trunk  he plunges downward and takes wing, and for a few moments you feel your heart soaring along with his.\n",
            "But in the new ‚ÄúDumbo,‚Äù our hero‚Äôs happy-sad flights of fancy aren‚Äôt the emotional culmination of the movie; they start early on and happen periodically, to gradually lesser effect. A bulgy little elephant, as suffused with feeling as a silent-movie clown, lofting himself into the air: That‚Äôs still a marvelous image. But the new ‚ÄúDumbo‚Äù is a meandering parable about the world‚Äôs attempt to corrupt it.\n",
            "Dumbo is born into a barnstorming circus run by the scuzzy carny barker Max Medici (Danny DeVito), who gets bought out by V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), an entrepreneur in a silvery wig so ornate it makes Andy Warhol‚Äôs look organic. Vandevere believes in the go-big-or-go-home school of entertainment. The year is 1919, and his ‚Äúcircus‚Äù is really the world‚Äôs first theme park, a place called Dreamland that‚Äôs as packed with rides, exhibits, and chicanery as a small city. He‚Äôs not a showman; he‚Äôs an exploiter. He looks at Dumbo and sees a gold mine, and he doesn‚Äôt deliver the elephant‚Äôs gift in all its cracked glory so much as he squeezes the wonder out of it through packaging.\n",

            "What on earth is the point of remaking Walt Disney‚Äôs great and possibly greatest masterpiece, the glorious animated musical from 1967, based on Kipling‚Äôs tales, all about the ‚Äúman cub‚Äù Mowgli, brought up by wolves in the Indian jungle ‚Äì famously the last film to get Disney‚Äôs personal touch? A remake which furthermore leaves old-fashioned animation behind, departing for the live-action uncanny valley of hyperreal CGI, which heretically loses most of the songs and which also abandons the original‚Äôs final, unforgettably exotic glimpse of a real-life human girl?\n",
            "Well, no point really ‚Ä¶ other than simply to create a terrifically enjoyable piece of old-fashioned storytelling and a beautiful-looking film: spectacular, exciting, funny and fun. It handsomely revives the spirit of Disney‚Äôs original film, while also having something of old-school family movies about animals like The Incredible Journey (1963) ‚Äì it almost feels like something I could have watched as a kid on TV. Yet also, weirdly, there‚Äôs a touch of Mel Gibson‚Äôs jungle nightmare Apocalypto (2006).\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps most strikingly of all, it re-imports into the story elements of the Disney classic The Lion King (1994) which The Jungle Book influenced in the first place: there‚Äôs a special rock for the animals to gather round, a stampede scene and an evil feline with a facial disfigurement.\n",
            "Newcomer Neel Sethi plays Mowgli himself; Ben Kingsley voices Bagheera the panther; Idris Elba is the evil tiger Shere Khan; Scarlett Johansson is the hissing snake mesmerist Kaa; Christopher Walken is the voice of King Louie the fire-hungry ape and inevitably ‚Äì but pleasingly, and very amusingly ‚Äì Bill Murray is an outstanding vocal turn as the notorious ursine slacker and pleasure-seeker Baloo the bear who teaches Mowgli the importance of kicking back and enjoying the bare necessities of life.\n",
            "I‚Äôve never seen digital rendering of talking animals look so persuasive and this film also creates witty and ingenious twists on the story we all know, including a new plot development concerning wolf-leader Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Shere Khan ‚Äì and even creates a backstory for Mowgli which explains how he got that modesty-preserving loincloth of his.\n",
            "It‚Äôs not a musical and yet the deployment of two famous songs ‚Äì The Bare Necessities and I Wanna Be Like You ‚Äì feels easy and natural. Actually, the film emphatically revives Kipling‚Äôs poem The Law of the Jungle with its collective all-for-one ethic: ‚ÄúThe strength of the pack is the wolf/And the strength of the wolf is the pack.‚Äù Baloo prefers songs to poems and calls that one ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù.\n",
            "Interestingly, where the first film finally sticks to a never-the-twain-shall-meet attitude to humans‚Äô long-term cohabitation with animals, this one posits the idea of living together happily (though that size of loincloth can‚Äôt last for ever). As I said, this sacrifices the original‚Äôs bittersweet acknowledgment that Mowgli must one day grow up and look for romance.\n",

            "Into the dark you tumble in ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland,‚Äù Tim Burton‚Äôs busy, garish and periodically amusing repo of the Lewis Carroll hallucination ‚ÄúAlice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland.‚Äù It‚Äôs a long fall turned long haul, despite the Burtonian flourishes ¬ó the pinch of cruelty, the mordant wit ¬ó that animate the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the porker that slides under her feet with a squeal. ‚ÄúI love a warm pig belly for my aching feet,‚Äù the queen tells Alice. Played by Mia Wasikowska, Alice looks a touch dazed: she seems to have left her pulse above ground when she fell down the rabbit hole of Mr. Burton‚Äôs imagination.\n",
            "Mr. Burton has done his best work with contemporary stories, so it‚Äôs curious if not curiouser that he‚Äôs turned his sights on another 19th-century tale. Perhaps after slitting all those throats in his adaptation of ‚ÄúSweeney Todd,‚Äù he thought he would chop off a few heads. Whatever his inspiration, he has tackled this new story with his customary mix of torpor and frenzy. After a short glance back at Alice‚Äôs childhood and an equally brief look at her present, he sends the 19-year-old on her way, first down the hole and then into a dreamscape ¬ó unfortunately tricked out with 3-D that distracts more than it delights ¬ó where she meets a grinning cat and a lugubrious caterpillar, among other fantastical creatures.\n",
            "Dark and sometimes grim, this isn‚Äôt your great-grandmother‚Äôs Alice or that of Uncle Walt, who was disappointed with the 1951 Disney version of ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlice has no character,‚Äù said a writer who worked on that project. ‚ÄúShe merely plays straight man to a cast of screwball comics.‚Äù Of course the character of Carroll‚Äôs original Alice is evident in each outrageous creation she dreams up in ‚ÄúWonderland‚Äù and in the sequel, ‚ÄúThrough the Looking-Glass,‚Äù which means that she‚Äôs a straight man to her own imagination. (She is Wonderland.) Here she mostly serves as a foil for the top biller Johnny Depp, who (yes, yes) plays the Mad Hatter, and Mr. Burton‚Äôs bright and leaden whimsies.\n",
            "Since narrative momentum isn‚Äôt Mr. Burton‚Äôs strength, ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù probably seemed a good fit for him, and there are moments when his transparent delight in the material lifts the movie and even carries it forward. His Wonderland (here, Underland) isn‚Äôt inviting or attractive.

            "In the spring of 1964 the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was very worried. NASA was about to fly the Mariner 4 space probe past Mars.\n",
            "That was 54 years ago. We still havent discovered intelligence or even believable evidence of pond scum anywhere else in the universe  not for lack of effort. A new spacecraft,TESS, designed to look for habitable nearby planetsjust vaulted into space, and aninterstellar asteroidrecently spotted streaking through the solar system was inspected for radio signals. Another robot is on its way tolisten in on the heart of Mars. We still dont know if we are alone.\n",
            "The story begins four million years ago in Africa, where a bunch of bedraggled primates are losing the battle of the survival of the fittest until a strange black monolith appears. To the thunder of Also Sprach Zarathustra, one of those apemen is inspired to pick up a bone and use it as a club to kill the animals that have been pushing him around.\n",
            "Around that toss Kubrick pivots his movie and all of human evolution. Another monolith appears on the moon, and yet another in orbit around Jupiter, where an astronaut named Dave Bowman connects with it after subduing a neurotic computer, the HAL 9000, which has murdered his shipmates. In the finale, Bowman is sent through a star gate on a trip through space and time, death and rebirth, returning as a glowing Star Child to float like a fetus over the Earth.\n",

Increasingly sophisticated and smaller machines have spread out to every world of the solar system,buzzing the rings of Saturn, daring thedark voids beyond Plutoandlanding on comets, scanning the heavens for new planets, new places to dream about. There have been enough robots, landers and orbiters violating the skies and surface of Mars to spark legends and myths and paranoia among whatever life-forms might be there.\n",
            "Worse, we may all be part of the dream. The news from some physicists likethe late Stephen Hawkingis thatthe universe might be a hologram, an illusion like the three-dimensional images on a bank card. Some cosmologists have argued that it is not inconsistent  at least mathematically  to imagine thatthe entire universe as we know it could just be a computer simulation,as in The Matrix  another movie with long shadows. In effect, we are all made of bits, so the argument goes, removable, deformable at the click of an interstellar mouse.\n",

            "Sooner or later, one of these self-satisfied, sublimely confident thinking machines is going to blow us all off the face of the planet. That is the message of \"WarGames,\" a scary and intelligent new thriller that is one of the best films so far this year. The movie starsMatthew Broderick(the kid from \"Max Dugan Returns\") as a bright high school senior who spends a lot of time locked in his bedroom with his home computer. He speaks computerese well enough to dial by telephone into the computer at his school and change grades. But he's ready for bigger game.\n",
            "He reads about a toy company that's introducing a new computer game. He programs his computer for a random search of telephone numbers in the company's area code, looking for a number that answers with a computer tone. Eventually, he connects with a computer. Unfortunately, the computer he connects with does not belong to a toy company. It belongs to the Defense Department, and its mission is to coordinate early warning systems and nuclear deterrents in the case of World War III. The kid challenges the computer to play a game called \"Global Thermonuclear Warfare,\" and it cheerfully agrees.\n",
            "As a premise for a thriller, this is a masterstroke. The movie, however, could easily go wrong by bogging us down in impenetrable computerese, or by ignoring the technical details altogether and giving us a \"Fail Safe\" retread. \"WarGames\" makes neither mistake. It convinces us that it knows computers, and it makes its knowledge into an amazingly entertaining thriller. (Note I do not claim the movie is accurate about computers -- only convincing.)\n",
            "I've described only the opening gambits of the plot, and I will reveal no more. It's too much fun watching the story unwind. Another one of the pleasures of the movie is the way it takes cardboard characters and fleshes them out. Two in particular: the civilian chief of the US computer operation, played byDabney Colemanas a man who has his own little weakness for simple logic, and the Air Force general in charge of the war room, played byBarry Corbinas a military man who argues that men, not computers, should make the final nuclear decisions.\n",

            "Extremely violent, extremely preposterous, extremely entertaining, \"The Matrix\" succeeds at two extremely difficult tasks: as a vast, exciting virtual-reality movie and as a defibrillator for Keanu Reeves' big screen career.\n",
            "Using the pantheon of movie iconography from the past 100 years - from \"High Noon\" showdowns, to bad kung fu, to love's first kiss - the writing/directing team of the Wachowski brothers, Larry and Andy, achieves a fantastic, hodgepodge symmetry using hacker noir, comedy and mindless action.\n",
            "Thomas Anderson (Reeves) is a talented computer programmer at a monolithic corporation during the day, but at night he's an unscrupulous hacker tagged Neo. His work brings him to the attention of Morpheus (Fishburne), a mysterious stranger who tantalizes Neo.\n",
            "Morpheus compares him to Lewis Carroll's Alice, with talk of other worlds and realities. He offers Neo two pills: a blue one, which will allow things to continue on as they have, and a red one, which purportedly will lift the veil from his eyes and allow him to see \"how deep the rabbit hole goes.\" This being a movie, and since the plot would pretty much stop here if he didn't, Neo takes the red one.\n",
            "When the veil does lift, it's Kafka meets \"Die Hard,\" and Neo realizes the awful truth that Morpheus has wanted him to see. It's a truth darker than \"Dark City,\" more memorable than \"Johnny Mnemonic\" and as terminal as \"The Terminator.\" It's bad for him, but it's good for us.\n",
            "The most critical aspect of this film's success is the creation of the Matrix world, a simulacrum of reality where most of the people in this film work, fight and die. The Wachowskis set up certain rules for this reality and try to stick to them - thus making the realm as important as the \"real\" world.\n",
            "Reeves, who in the past has been accused of being kind of a virtual-reality effect himself, acquits himself nicely as Neo. The long, lingering stench of \"Johnny Mnemonic\" dissipates in the first few moments of the film.\n",
            "Actually, it isn't dissipated, it's blown away with the exhilarating opening fight sequence. It's a desperate chase between Trinity (a Sigourney Weaver career jump-starter role for Carrie-Anne Moss) and the Matrix agents. \n",
            "It's evident that the Wachowski brothers (whose last effort was the erotic cranker \"Bound\") brought something extra to the table. Someone else's treatment of their script could have turned into a ponderous, gorgeous, somber affair, like \"Dark City.\"\n",
            "Most hacker noir films seem to vie for the \"Blade Runner\" production design award, entirely forgetting their audience and their story. Not the Wachowskis. They're like little kids playing with blocks, building and constructing. Then they use the wow-filled, \"Flo-mo\" and \"bullet time\" special effects of Jon Gaeta and the designs of Owen Paterson to knock those blocks down.\n",
            "And knock they do, demolishing the wall between the standard \"question reality\" movie and an action film. When the dust settles, \"The Matrix\" is all that's left standing.\n",

            "'I, Robot\" takes place in Chicago circa 2035, a city where spectacular new skyscrapers share the skyline with landmarks like the Sears (but not the Trump) Tower. The tallest of the buildings belongs to U.S. Robotics, and on the floor of its atrium lobby lies the dead body of its chief robot designer, apparently a suicide.\n",
            "Det. Del Spooner is on the case.Will Smithplays Spooner, a Chicago Police Department detective who doesn't think it's suicide. He has a deep-seated mistrust of robots, despite the famous Three Laws of Robotics, which declare above all that a robot must not harm a human being.\n",
            "The dead man is Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who, we are told, wrote the Three Laws. Every schoolchild knows the laws were set down by the good doctor Isaac Asimov, after a conversation he had on Dec. 23, 1940, withJohn W. Campbell, the legendary editor of Astounding Science Fiction. It is peculiar that no one in the film knows that, especially since the film is \"based on the book by Isaac Asimov.\" Would it have killed the filmmakers to credit Asimov?\n",
            "The movie makes Spooner into another one of those movie cops who insults the powerful, races recklessly around town, gets his badge pulled by his captain, solves the crime and survives incredible physical adventures. In many of these exploits he is accompanied by Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), whose job at U.S. Robotics is \"to make the robots seem more human.\"\n",
            "At this she is not very successful. The movie's robots are curiously uninvolving as individuals, and when seen by the hundreds or thousands look like shiny chromium ants. True, a robot need not have much of a personality, but there is one robot, named Sonny and voiced byAlan Tudyk, who is more advanced than the standard robot, more \"human,\" and capable of questions like \"What am I?\" -- a question many movie characters might profitably ask themselves.\n",
            "If Sonny doesn't have real feelings, he comes as close to them as any of the humans in the movie. Both Spooner and Calvin are kept in motion so relentlessly that their human sides get overlooked, except for a touching story Spooner tells about how a little girl dies because a robot was too logical. Sonny doesn't seem as \"human\" as, say, Andrew, the robot played byRobin Williamsin \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999), based on a robot story by Asimov andRobert Silverberg. But his voice has a certain poignancy, and suggests some the chilly chumminess of HAL 9000.\n",
            "The plot I will not detail, except to note that you already know from the ads that the robots are up to no good, and Spooner could write a lot of tickets for Three Laws violations.\n",
            "As for the robots, they function like the giant insects in \"Starship Troopers,\" as video game targets. You can't even be mad at them, since they're only programs. Although, come to think of it, youcanbe mad at programs; Microsoft Word has inspired me to rage far beyond anything these robots engender.\n",

Non genre filmgoers should probably get excited too. For the first time in a long time, we have an artificial intelligence film with, well, intelligence.\n",
            "Ex Machina, novelist and screenwriterAlex Garlandsdirectorial debut, treads on the well-worn sci-fi territory of technophobia, god complexes, and lethal robots, but it does so with an intelligence and sophistication that never underestimates either the viewer or the capacity of the genre.\n",
            "The film kicks off when a nice young coder named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a mysterious trip to spend a week at the opulent home (more of a compound, really) of Nathan (Oscar Isaac), his boss and CEO of fictional internet giant Blue Book. During his visit, Caleb meets two women: Nathans assistant and lover Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) and his invention, a robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ava the robot is a CGI confection made of human face, hands, and feet held together by sinewy mesh, translucent limbs, and a see-through torso filled with blinking lights, and whirring gears.\n",
            "Nathan tasks Caleb with engaging Ava in the Turing test (yes,named forthatTuring) in order to determine whether his artificially intelligent creation can think and act like a human. As you might expect in a film about a vulnerable young man, an alluring robot girl, and a billionaire with a god complex locked up in a high-tec bunker, things start to go horribly wrong.\n",
            "Nathans claustrophobic underground lair takes on the feel of that classic sci-fi setting: the spaceship. But wide exterior shots (filmed on location in Norway) of lush forests and one particularly stunning glacier play the role of outer space, putting mans small, technological accomplishments in the context of natures vast splendor.\n",
            "That blurred relationship between the organic and inorganic used to best effect in Avas elegant flesh and mesh design  crops up throughoutEx Machinato underline the notion of artificial intelligence as the next, inevitable phase in our evolution. Vikanders face moves robotically, yes, but also takes on a curious bird-like quality  bright eyes blinking and inquisitive head tilting.\n",
            "Ex Machinacertainly isnt theonlysuccessful artificial intelligence film out there, and Vikanders crackling honey voice and seductive demeanor make the comparison toScarlett JohanssoninHerpretty inevitable. But whileSpike Jonzesfilm was all heart,Ex Machinais just brimming with brains. For every obvious cultural reference to scientific disaster (you bet Robert Oppenheimer gets quoted), theres a subtle one, like snippets of Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Darks 1980s anthem Enola Gay. And Garland never lets his camera linger too long on one ofEx Machinas visual punches like a fully humanoid robot dressed all in white pausing in front of Klimts iconic portrait of Margaret Stonborough Wittgenstein.\n",

            "As the movie continues, and the viewer learns more of what an ordinary guy Theodore ishe checks his e-mail on the ride home from work, just like pretty much all of us these daysdirector Jonze, who also wrote the movie's script, constructs a beguiling cinematic world that also starts to embrace the viewer. The way Theodore's smart phone and its earpiece work is different from ours, and soon it becomes clear that \"Her\" is something of a science-fiction film, set in the not-too-distant but distinctly fantastic future. \n",
            "The futuristic premise sets the stage for an unusual love story: one in which Theo, still highly damaged and sensitive over the breakup of his marriage (\"I miss you,\" a friend tells him in a voice mail message; \"Not the sad, mopey you. The old, fun you\"), falls in love with the artificially intelligent operating system of his computer. The movie shows this product advertised and, presumably, bought in remarkable quantity, but focuses on Theo's interaction with his OS, which he gives a female voice. The female voice gives herself the name \"Samantha\" and soon Samantha is reorganizing Theo's files, making him laugh, and developing something like a human consciousness.\n",
            "It's in Theo and Samantha's initial interaction that \"Her\" finds its most interesting, and troubling depths. Samantha, being, you know, a computer, has the ability to process data, and a hell of a lot of it, at a higher speed than human Theo. \"I can understand how the limited perspective can look to the non-artificial mind,\" she playfully observes to Theo. And while Samantha's programming is designed to make her likable to Theo, her assimilation of humanity's tics soon have the operating system feeling emotion, or the simulation of it, and while the viewer is being beguiled by the peculiarities and particularities of Theo and Samantha's growing entanglement, he or she is also living through a crash course on the question of what it means to be human.\n",
            "At first Theo feels a little odd about his new \"girlfriend,\" and then finds out that his pal Amy (Amy Adams) is getting caught up in a relationship with the OS left behind by her estranged husband. Jonze drops funny hints about what the existence of artificial intelligence in human society might affect that society. He also gets off some pretty good jokes concerning video games.\n",
            "But he also creates moments of genuinely upsetting heartbreak, as in Theo's inability to understand what went wrong with his marriage to Catherine (Rooney Mara, quite wonderful in what could have been a problematic role) and their continuing inadvertent emotional laceration of each other at their sole \"present\" meeting in the movie.\n",
            "\"Her\" remains one of the most engaging and genuinely provocative movies you're likely to see this year, and definitely a challenging but not inapt date movie.\n",

In this nail-biting Orionsci-fiadventure fromHemdale, the beefyConanstar, cast in his first villainous role, dishes out destruction with a fiendish relish certain to neutralize box-office competition. The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind sinceThe Road Warrior.\n",

Tracking him is MichaelBiehn, assigned to protect the girl and terminate the Terminator. On the outcome of their struggle  as eerieflashforwardsto the skull-lined streets of21stcentury Los Angeles remind us rests the future of the world.\n",
            "A remarkably spare script by James Cameron and Gale AnneHurdgives new dimension to this age-old morality play, working in plenty of pointed comment on our presentovermechanizationinto its action-film context. Images do most of the talking, and Cameron, in his first major directorial effort, proves a lean, economical storyteller, setting up his shorts for maximum visceral impact.\n",
            "Cameron is ably abetted by Adam Greenberg's crisp, incisive camerawork; MarkGoldblatt'sfine-tooled editing, which discreetly cuts away from most of the bloodshed, and Brad Fidel'spulsatinglypersuasive score. The futuristic landscapes are impressively sketched by the Fantasy II visual effects group and Stan Winston provides stop-motion magic that recalls the best of RayHarryhausen.\n",
            "The most imposing special effect, however, is Schwarzenegger himself. Outfitted from head to toe in basic black and armed to the teeth with state-of-the-art weaponry, the ex-strong man comes on like evil incarnate, and his bullet-pumping presence lends the film a very tangible sense of menace. His single-handed destruction of an intercity police station is certain to rank high in the annals of on-screen dastardly deeds.\n",
            "Schwarzenegger has a worthy adversary in MichaelBiehn, whose grimly determined features expressively convey most of the film's thematic weight. Linda Hamilton displays tremendous resiliency as the unsuspecting target, and there is some engaging support from Paul Winfield and LanceHenriksenas harried detectives. But it's Arnold's movie all the way.\n",
